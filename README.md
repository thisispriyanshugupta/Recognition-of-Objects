# Object Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on recognizing objects in images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The CIFAR-10 dataset, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, is utilized for this task. The objective is to build a CNN model capable of accurately identifying objects across various categories.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocess the images, and prepare them for model training.
   
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its distribution and characteristics.
   
3. **Model Building**: Construct a Sequential model with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers suitable for object recognition.
   
4. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model with appropriate optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
   
5. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data.
   
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set and visualize predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thisispriyanshugupta/Recognition-of-Objects.git
   cd Recognition-of-Objects
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Load and Preprocess Data

```python
import keras

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# Preprocess the image data
X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255
```

### Explore the Data

```python
print('Training Images:', X_train.shape)
print('Testing Images:', X_test.shape)

# Visualize sample images from the dataset
# Example data exploration steps...
```

### Build the Model

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten

model = Sequential()
# Define the CNN architecture
# Example model architecture...
```

### Compile the Model

```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'], optimizer='adam')
```

### Train the Model

```python
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test))
```

### Evaluate the Model

```python
model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)
```

### Visualize Predictions

```python
# Generate predictions for a batch of test images
# Visualize the predictions alongside actual labels
# Example visualization steps...
```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set. Further improvements can be made through hyperparameter tuning and exploring more complex architectures.
